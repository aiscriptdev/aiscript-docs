> 
```
### aiscript new

Create a new AIScript project with a standard directory structure.

$ aiscript new [PROJECT_NAME]
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ aiscript new test-project
Successfully created new AIScript project: test-project
Project structure:

├── lib/
├── routes/
│   └── index.ai
└── project.toml


Run `aiscript serve` to start the server.
```

### aiscript serve

- `--port`: Port to listen on (default: 8000)
- `--host`: Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--reload`: Run in development mode with hot reloading


## aim

The **aim** (AIScript Manager) is a command-line tool for AIScript, similar to [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) for Rust. It provides a comprehensive set of commands to help you build, test, and deploy web applications quickly.

### aim ai <Badge text="Not supported yet" type="warning" />

Generate AI applications built in AIScript from a prompt description.

```bash
$ aim ai [PROMPT_FILE]
```

This command analyzes a prompt and generates a complete AIScript application based on the description.

**Example:**

```bash
$ cat prompts.txt
Please write a chatbot app that can answer questions about the
following topics:
- history
- geography

$ aim ai prompts.txt
```

The generated application will include all necessary files, routes, and AI integration to build the described chatbot.

### aim compile <Badge text="Not supported yet" type="warning" />

Compile an AIScript project into executable code.

```bash
$ aim compile [--release]
```

**Options:**

- `--release`: Compile in release mode with optimizations

This command validates your code and compiles it to an executable format.

### aim deploy <Badge text="Not supported yet" type="warning" />

Deploy an AIScript project to the aiscript.dev server.

```bash
$ aim deploy [--env=production]
```

**Options:**

- `--env`: Target environment (default: production)

This command packages your application and deploys it to the AIScript cloud hosting service.

### aim debug <Badge text="Not supported yet" type="warning" />

Open an interactive, Postman-like debug UI in the browser for testing your API routes.

```bash
$ aim debug [--port=8001]
```

**Options:**

- `--port`: Port to use for the debug UI (default: 8001)

The debug UI automatically imports your API routes, allowing you to test endpoints with different parameters and view responses.

### aim fmt <Badge text="Not supported yet" type="warning" />
